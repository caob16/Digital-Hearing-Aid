# Digital-Hearing-Aid
-This Project is based-on Matlan DSP ToolBox. Plz install it before u try to run the code.
-This project focuses on developing digital solutions for individuals with mild hearing loss by transitioning conventional hardware-based hearing aid algorithms into sophisticated software algorithms deployable on smart devices like smartphones and smartwatches. The genesis of this innovative idea and its strategic planning is a testament to individual creativity and initiative.

Key achievements include:

Engineering a microphone circuit inspired by the MAX9814 model, featuring automatic gain control. The comprehensive circuit design comprises a microphone system, power supply, Notch filter, Type II Sallen-Key filter, and an AGC circuit.
Crafting advanced hearing aid algorithms utilizing DSP techniques in Matlab, tailored to enhance auditory processing. This encompasses a frequency division algorithm attuned to auditory characteristics, noise reduction capabilities (spectral subtraction, adaptive filtering), speech recognition, and a FIR filter configured for varying frequency bands, supplemented by a WDRC algorithm.
Creating a user-friendly interface, allowing for self-testing and personalized gain adjustments, elevating user autonomy and experience.
Progressing towards integrating the designed hearing aid algorithm into mobile phones, leveraging a microphone array for real-time noise cancellation.
This repository serves as a hub for this project's ongoing development and documentation, illustrating both the technical journey and the impactful potential of digital audiology advancements.
